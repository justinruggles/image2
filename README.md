### More image.Image types ###

I was quite surprised when I found that the Go image package does not have any
RGB image types without alpha. Also, it lacks grayscale with alpha. So I decided
to write them myself.

### API Documentation ###

There are 2 packages:
[image2](http://godoc.org/github.com/justinruggles/image2)
and
[image2/color2](http://godoc.org/github.com/justinruggles/image2/color2)
